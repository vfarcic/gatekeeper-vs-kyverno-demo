      A Kubernetes service of type NodePort uses a host port to receive traffic from 
      any source. A 'NetworkPolicy' resource cannot be used to control traffic to host ports. 
      Although 'NodePort' services can be useful, their use must be limited to services 
      with additional upstream security checks.
